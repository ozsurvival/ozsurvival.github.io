 Firstly welcome, many of you might not realise the amount of um-ing and ah-ing that went into the creation of this site. I've put this off for years. Sometimes for valid reasons sometimes just because it all seemed to hard. Well, to prove the addage you can't teach an old dog new tricks wrong, I've embraised my doubts and just said get it done. As a lecturer of digital media recently pointed out to me you can fake it till you make it. So I thought I'd do that.

 This site was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and specifically the detailed instructions provided by [J. McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), to whom I can't thank enough. It is currently hosted on github, with a backup provided by a friend in the UK. The page runs because of the collective works of an amazing crew of free software hackers, and without them it wouldn't be half as easy to approach this work.
