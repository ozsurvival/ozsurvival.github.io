Before I get started talking about gear, I want to work back through the rule of 3's. If we are honest with ourselves are we just ignoring the rule of 3's and thinking we can buy ourselves success, it won't work, it's always function over form.

Guanche Line, layering, level 0, it doesn't matter what you call it, we mean the things you wear. If we want to maximise or ability to cope in any situation we should start with what protection does our immediate shelter provides. Does our choice of clothing meet the requirements to keep us alive should something untoward strikes? 

Non-tactical, tactical clothing: This has been a blessing in recent years, no longer will you look like an Army reject whilst trying to fond some clothing that might live through a week* in austere conditions. Major brands now have well made functional pants and shirts that can in a pinch survive outdoor wear.  This doesn't limit you to protective work gear which was my go-to option, it also means your not limited to blue and kharki. 

At worse get strive to get a comfortable set of clothing and spare that can be for emergencies. Better still look as your replacing items of worn clothing to building a function wardrobe whilst removing clutter, remember holey sock are a nuisance and need to be fixed, recycled, or removed.

In Australia we might be looking to what should this wardrobe include:

<ul>
<li>3 pairs of long pants</li>
<li>3 pairs of shorts</li>
<li>3 shirts</li>
<li>5 pairs of socks, underwear, t shirts.</li>
<li>2 pairs of comfortable work boots.</li>
<li>1 pair of running/fitness shoes.</li>
<li>2 Jumpers</li>
</ul>

Add to this any seasonal wear you might need depending on your location, you'll likely not need snow gear in FNQ, and vice versa. Also, I'm not including specific workwear, which again is highly dependent on your location and job.

A great article talking over these ideas was written by [Swift Silent Deadly](https://swiftsilentdeadly.com/edc-part-0-a-case-for-the-individual-uniform/)

*Nor should you: looking like a member of the military will likely cause more issues should anything happen.
