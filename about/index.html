<p><h2>Meet the team...</h2>
This has been the work of, and been inpired by a lot of people, as we move forward I expect more input for now, a brief introduction</p>
<p><h2>hp</h2>
I've spent the best part of 20 years in and around the survivalist, preparedness and wider communities. I've travelled half way round the world and back. I'm a qualified engineer, and blacksmith, and have had the oppurtunity to work on a range of farms in australia both horticutural and animal agriculture after studying Organic Agricultural practices. I'm now semi retired, study Philosophy, aswell as being a stay at home dad to my lovely kids. I'm committed to spreading information about various skills and techniques I've learned over the years and making this accesable within a rational discussion about survivalism and preparedness. <br>Always the clown, never where they're meant to be...</p>
